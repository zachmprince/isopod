# Force Inversion Example

In a force inversion problem, we use inverse optimization to match the primary
variable (e.g. displacement and temperature) by parameterizing gradients of the
primary variables (e.g. force and heat flux).  This is a linear optimization or
linear programming problem, the parameters are not dependent on the solution and are the
simplest type of optimization problem.  We will present three
force inversion problems in this section for steady state heat conduction where the following types of loadings are parameterized:

- Example 1: Point Loads

- Example 2: Neumann Boundary Condition

- Example 3: Distributed Body Load

- Example 4: Dirichlet Boundary Condition

## Steady State Heat Conduction

All of the examples in this section are parameterizing force loads for steady state
[heat conduction](/heat_conduction/index.md) in a solid.  Below we, copy the
equations for steady state heat conduction from the the [heat conduction](/heat_conduction/index.md)
section from the MOOSE module.  The differential equation describing steady
state he conduction is given by

\begin{equation}\label{eq:heat_equation}
  0 = \nabla k(\vec{x}) \nabla T + q ~\text{for}~\vec{x} \in \Omega,
\end{equation}

where $T$ is temperature, $\vec{x}$ is the vector of spatial coordinates, $k$ is the thermal conductivity, $q$ is a heat source, and $\Omega$ is the domain.

Boundary conditions for the heat equation are defined on the boundary of the domain $\partial \Omega$. The boundary is divided into Dirichlet boundaries $\partial \Omega_D$ and Robin boundaries $\partial \Omega_R$ such that $\partial \Omega = \partial \Omega_D \cup \partial \Omega_R$:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
   T(\vec{x}) &= T_D(\vec{x}) &~\text{for}~\vec{x}\in \partial \Omega_D  \\
   -k \vec{n} \cdot \nabla T - G(\vec{x},T) &= 0 &~\text{for}~\vec{x}\in \partial \Omega_R,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where $T_D$ and $G(t,\vec{x},T)$ are known functions and $\vec{n}$ is the outward normal at $\vec{x}$. The function $G(\vec{x},T)$ defines the type of Robin boundary conditions. Common cases for $G$ are:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\label{eq:robin_bc_types}
   &\text{Neumann:     }~G(\vec{x},T) = 0 \\
   &\text{Convection:  }~G(\vec{x},T) = h (T - T_{\infty}) \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

## Example 1: Point Loads

In this example we are parameterizing the heat source intensity at the locations indicated by the $\bigcirc$ symbols in [figSetup] that will produce a temperature field that most closely matches the temperature measurements taken at the points indicated by the $\times$ symbols.  Dirichlet boundary conditions are applied to the entire boundary with T=300.

## Main Application Input

Optimization problems are solved using the [MultiApps] system.  The main application contains the optimization executioner and the sub-applications solve the forward and adjoint PDE.   The main application input is shown in [master_app].

!listing test/tests/formfunction/objective_gradient_minimize/point_loads/master.i
         id=master_app
         caption=Main application optimization input for point load parameterization shown in [figSetup]

The main application runs the optimization executioner and transfers data from the optimization executioner back and forth to the sub-apps that are running the actual Forward and adjoint FEM simulations.  Since no mesh or physics kernels are required on the main app, we use the [StochasticTools](syntax/StochasticTools/index.md) action to set up all of the nullkernels, empty mesh, etc. needed to get a MOOSE simulation to run.  

The [optimize](Optimize.md) executioner block, shown below, provides an interface with the [PETSc TAO](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/documentation/taosolvertable.html) optimization library. The optimization algorithm is selected with `tao_solver` with specific solver options set with `petsc_options`.


!listing test/tests/formfunction/objective_gradient_minimize/point_loads/master.i
         block=Executioner

The `Optimize` executioner requires a [FormFunction](syntax/FormFunction/index.md), shown below, to transfer data between the optimization executioner and the transfers used for communicating with the sub-apps.  The type of `FormFunction` depends on the optimization algorithm, given by teh  

!listing test/tests/formfunction/objective_gradient_minimize/point_loads/master.i
         block=FormFunction



The optimization executioner on the main app does not need a mesh or variables and uses the action to set-up a dummy mesh and variables.

The first step is to define the simulation to perform, in this case the simulation considered is a 2D
steady state diffusion equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions on each end of the domain: find $u$
such that

!equation
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} = 0 \quad x \in [0,1],

where $u(0) = U(0, 0.5)$, $u(1) = U(1,2)$, and $U(a,b)$ defines a
[continuous uniform distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_distribution_%28continuous%29)
with $a$ and $b$ defining the lower and upper limits of the distribution, respectively.



## Sub-Application Input

The problem defined above, with respect to the [MultiApps] system, is a sub-application. The
complete input file for the problem is provided in [master-app]. The only item required
to enable the stochastic analysis is the [Controls] block, which contains a
[SamplerReceiver](/SamplerReceiver.md) object, the use of which will be explained
in the following section.

## Master Input

The master application, with respect to the [MultiApps] system, is the driver of the stochastic
simulations, by itself it does not perform a solve. The complete input file for the master
application is shown in [monte-carlo-master], but the import sections will be detailed individually.

First, [Distributions] for each of the two stochastic boundary conditions are defined.

!listing test/tests/formfunction/objective_gradient_minimize/function_load/master.i block=FormFunction

Second, a [MonteCarloSampler](/MonteCarloSampler.md) is defined that utilizes the
two distributions and creates the Monte Carlo samples.

!listing test/tests/formfunction/objective_gradient_minimize/function_load/master.i block=FormFunction

Notice, that this sampler only executes on "initial", which means that the random numbers are
created once during the initial setup of the problem and not changed again during the simulation.

Next, a [SamplerTransientMultiApp](/SamplerTransientMultiApp.md) object is created. This object
creates and runs a sub-application for each sample provided by the sampler object.

!listing test/tests/formfunction/objective_gradient_minimize/function_load/master.i block=MultiApps

Finally, the [SamplerParameterTransfer](/SamplerParameterTransfer.md) is utilized to communicate the
sampler data to the sub-application. The 'parameters' input lists the parameters on the
sub-applications to perturb and the 'to_control' specifies the
[SamplerReceiver](/SamplerReceiver.md) object in the sub-application.
